# pluto_rover

Further changes:
A file reader could be implemented, to read the coordinates of the obstacles instead of generation every 5th square.
The rover could detect the obstacles with its own hardware (so with an external method).
The map wraparound could be fixed since right now it's more of a wraparound square rather than a sphere.
There could be a better way to handle invalid input with exceptions, rather than in the switch statement.
